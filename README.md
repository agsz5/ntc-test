# NtcTest

NTC Home assignment: 'EU Population Browser'. This project was generated with Angular CLI version 15.2.0.

## Runnin the project

- Clone the Git repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run serve-ntc` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Home Assignment Focus

The objectives for this assignment were:

1. To implement as much functionality as possible (even outside specification) to make the data browsing more convenient and more conducive to generating insights: sorting mechanisms, filtering, pagination, and text autocomplete

2. To do so in 5 hours or less.

In retrospect, this may not have been the most optimal approach.

## Known Bugs

Some time was spent trying to make the "mat-table" for city data paginated and sortable, but it kept clashing with the country form control. Given the time constraints, the city data table was left as a basic table.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run cypress:run` to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress
